There are a few introductory steps that are required before you are able to make requests to Blizzard API endpoints and retrieve resource data.

Blizzard uses a third party service called [Mashery](http://www.mashery.com/) in order to provide their services and documentation. The service powers APIs of leading brands in retail, media, business services, software, and more. By signing in to a Mashery powered portal, you can gain access to Mashery's base of API providers. All with a single Mashery ID.

Regarding this situation, developers must register a new user account that does not use the login credentials of Battle.net account. Due the severe security implications of using the same email and password in other services, it is highly recommended to use an email address and password that is different from the services you typically use.

Please use proper security practices and use strong password conventions. This is especially true considering the fact that malicious intent could be used in conjunction with the credentials associated with your registered Applications. It is important to keep a security barrier to prevent that could affect the reputation of Blizzard reserves the right and discretion to terminate the account and any associated applications that may be live.
