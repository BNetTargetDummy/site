GravCMS defines **Pages** as the fundamental building-blocks of a site. Specifically pages have two important parts to them. The most important part when constructing a page is the **content** section, usually written in markdown (although HTML is supported and other parsing methods can be supported through a plugin). Another part is the definition part called **frontmatter**, parametrizes input to for different output scenarios. Final is the folder structured ensuring that the system is intuitive to navigate.

The system can be used in conjunction with powerful taxonomy capabilities, which is still powerful enough to handle complex content requirements where category and tagging gives powerful filters to a variety content type. 

At TargetDummy we take advantage of these conventions of structure and design patterns to make statically and dynamically generated content approachable for novices and experts alike.
