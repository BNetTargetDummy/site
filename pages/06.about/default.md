## What is TargetDummy?

TargetDummy is an all-in-one testing solution for developers working with Blizzard's API. It enables you to test your code in many different ways, discover and report bugs found with the API, and test your code for errors.

It's our goal to make life easier for developers that work with the Blizzard API. 

### Command Line Interface Tools

TargetDummy includes a set of easy-to-use command line tools that make it easier than ever to test your application. It is an event driven architecture taking advantage of NodeJS async nature.

With multi-database engine support, you can test your application - regardless of your database enviornment.

### Collaborative Chat Bot

Imagine being able to test your app from the convenience of a chatroom you can access anywhere. TargetDummy makes that possible with its Discord bot.

### Bug Reporting

Blizzard's bug-reporting system is a cluttered and impossible to organize forum. Issues are often reported without enough information for Blizzard to take action, resulting in long delays in fixes.

TargetDummy detects bugs in the API and reports these issues to Blizzard in a concise, accurate way.

## Why Create TargetDummy?

Simply put: we needed tools for working with Blizzard APIs that didn't exist. We set out to create a solution that would be the next evolutionary step in working with Blizzard APIs.

We noticed that issues reported using Blizzard's existing system often fell through the cracks. This was because there is no real bug tracking system in place. Issues that were fixed were usually not reported through official communication methods at large, so tracking recurrent issues was not possible.

We also found that there was no testing methodology that universally applied between various project scopes.

So, a few of our developers banded together to create a new solution.

The team settled on the name TargetDummy, a testing Non Playing Character (NPC)  typically used in games to practice for key combination points. Thus the step for an all-in-one testing solution was born, and we are excited for what is to come.

## What Makes TargetDummy Different?

TargetDummy is by developers, for developers. It is being created independently and apart from corporate interests. It's our goal to make your project work to its full potential. 

This means having more meaningful testing tools that go beyond the ones provided by the company. Reporting tools ensure that results are concise and accurate, making it easier to troubleshoot.

TargetDummy gives developers a more fluent and complete development experience.
