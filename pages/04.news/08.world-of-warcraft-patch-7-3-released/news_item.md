For players, this update gives characters access to the heart of the Burning Legion’s stronghold, Argus. Argus is the homeworld of the Eredar and base of operations for the Burning Legion as it mounts its offensive against Azeroth.

Players will gain a new dungeon in Seat of the Triumvirate, utilize the Netherlight Crucible to augment their Artifact Relics, and enjoy a plethora of new animations as they explore Argus. 

Here are some of the API-related updates we are looking forward to:

* New Quests updated for current Community API (confirmed)
* New Mounts  updated for current Community API (confirmed)
* New Items updated for current Community API (confirmed)
* New Talents updated for current Community API (confirmed)
* New Spell updated for current Community API (confirmed)
* New Character Achievements

So, as far as patches go, this is shaping up to be a really exciting one! Not only does it add a ton of depth to the ongoing saga of the Burning Legion, but to explore a whole new area of the WoW universe.

New animations, new items, artifact customization are just icing on the cake.
