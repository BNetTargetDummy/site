Blizzard's presentation at Gamescom 2017 in Cologne, Germany featured Disney-style musical animations, hero skins, World of Warcraft patch updates, and more.

Here at TargetDummy, we were encouraged by several of announcements Blizzard made regarding World of Warcraft, and the possibility of future opportunities coming to Overwatch.

## What We Didn't Hear About

What we didn't hear about at Gamescom was any API updates coming to Diablo, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, or StarCraft. This wasn't  unexpected, and we are anxiously looking forward to BlizzCon this November. 

Blizzard did highlight a new series of Hearthstone books and shorts coming out. These center around a new cast of characters in the Hearthstone world that Blizzard hints will one day have an impact on the way players experience Hearthstone. Could this be an interactive inn players can relax in between games?

Heroes of the Storm will also be receiving some new hero skins. Also, the highly-anticipated arrival of Kel’thuzad to the Nexus is finally happening.

## Overwatch

Overwatch didn't receive any official news on the API front. However, there was a promising sidebar made during a demo of the new Juketown map that hints at great things to come.

One of the developers participating in the demo states, "We're working towards providing a lot more stats. Not just for players' match history, but also for esports."

Indeed, Blizzard is working to make Overwatch a major esports property. Its upcoming esports arena, called the Blizzard Arena, is set to open on October 7th and the first event on the agenda is the Overwatch Contenders Season One Playoffs.

As of yet, Overwatch does not have an API. This lack of data hooks makes it very difficult to track player performance and stats, limiting its potential for adoption as teams and pro players alike rely on this information to better target training and improve performance.

## World of Warcraft

Where Blizzard did provide actionable information was regarding World of Warcraft. 

Blizzard announced that patch 7.3 would be available as early as the 29th of August. In this patch, players will experience the story of the ancient Eredar civilization. 

Players can explore Argus on the Vindicar, a Draenei ship, and travel through the very portals the Legion uses to unleash havoc on worlds.

Some of the possible new updates to data endpoints include:

* New items
* New mounts
* New achievements

That's pretty much it for Blizzard's Gamescom 2017 announcements. We are anxiously anticipating BlizzCon coming up in November and will of course keep you apprised of any changes and updates to come.
