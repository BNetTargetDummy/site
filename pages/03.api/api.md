# Blizzard API Developer Experience

With the need to have more concise and accurate developer documentation, the **TargetDummy** team decided there was a need to have better documentation for both beginner and seasoned developers. For maintainability the documentation is written with **Markdown** format with embeded **YAML** structures for prebuilt block level elements.

We cannot gaurentee the documents to be up-to-date or accurate. With knowledge of such, because the docuemnts are written in an open way you can make a pull request preferably on **Github** to make any necessary additions and/or corrections. We also allow onsite editing directly through the website, for more seasoned editors that will be making continuous updates for all parts of the website. Approval must be made before being given administrative access with a begining introduction to **GetGrav CMS**. Before adding to these documents we suggest looking at the documentation guide.

_NOTE: Blizzard does not control the documentation here. Please do not contact them regarding changes on this website._
